Plane Crash Causes,"Illustrations on various plane crash causes. Hover to see specific cause categories."
Pilot Error,"A decision, action or inaction by a pilot or crew of an aircraft. This category includes specific causes such as improper procedure, improper procedure, and navigation error."
Improper procedure,"On March 18, 2005, a Cessna 175, N7148M was caused from the pilot's failure to follow the checklist by his failure to verify the fuel selector was in the on position which resulted in fuel starvation and the loss of engine power."
Flying VFR into IFR conditions,"Operating the aircraft under VFR means to fly a plane solely by reference to outside visual cues, such as the horizon to maintain orientation in relatively clear weather conditions. When the visual cues outside the aircraft are obscured by weather or darkness, IFR(instrument flight rules) must be used instead."
Controlled flight into terrain,"A controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is an accident in which an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a mountain, a body of water or an obstacle."
Descending below minima,"In Crossair Flight 3597 crash, The fact that Captain Loehrer made no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude also directly contributed to the crash."
Spatial disorientation,"In aviation, the term means the inability to correctly interpret aircraft attitude, altitude or airspeed, in relation to the Earth or point of reference, especially after a reference point (e.g., the horizon) has been lost. Spatial disorientation is a condition in which an aircraft pilot's perception of direction does not agree with reality."
Premature descent,"When the plane was still far from its destination, a premature descent is dangerous especially when the plane was flying over mountainous terrain."
Excessive landing speed,"Executing a perfect landing with excessive airspeed is difficult because the margin of error is tiny. The pitch attitude especially must be carefully handled to prevent bouncing or ballooning. Excessive landing speed is a common factor that leads to landing accidents."
Missed runway,"Missing the runway could happen when the visibility is so foul that a pilot making a landing attempt literally can’t see well enough to land and the instrumentation being followed isn’t precise enough to put the aircraft directly over it. "
Fuel starvation,"Fuel starvation and fuel exhaustion (sometimes referred to as fuel depletion) are problems that can affect internal combustion engines fuelled by either diesel, kerosene, petroleum or any other combustible liquid or gas, causing the total cease of operation of the engine. When it occurs to aircraft in flight, it would lead to a crash."
Navigation error,"On Wednesday 7 September 2016, An AirAsia flight from Sydney to Malaysia ended up in Melbourne instead when the pilot entered the wrong coordinates into the internal navigation system."
Wrong runway takeoff or landing,"On January 30, 2001, Comair Flight 5191was assigned the airport's Runway 22 for the takeoff, but used Runway 26 instead.Runway 26 was too short for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun the end of the runway before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew."
Midair collision caused by both pilots,"A mid-air collision is an aviation accident in which two or more aircraft come into unplanned contact during flight. Owing to the relatively high velocities involved and the likelihood of subsequent impact with the ground or sea, very severe damage or the total destruction of at least one of the aircraft involved usually results."
Mechanical,"This category contains engine failure, equipment failure, structural failure, design flaw, and maintenance error"
Engine failure,"On 26 August 2007, an Antonov An-32B crashed at Kongolo Airport experienced engine trouble about ten minutes after takeoff. The aircraft struck trees and crashed later, and all three crew members and 11 of the 12 passengers died."
Equipment failure,"When airplane equipment failures involve navigation systems, altimeters or communications the results can be fatal, especially on private flights that aren't being actively tracked by radar."
Structural failure,"The structure failure could be improper size or shape, improper selection of materials, failing to adhere to the design, or from lack of consideration of unexpected problems."
Design flaw,"The 1952 Farnborough Airshow DH.110 crash was an air show accident involving a de Havilland DH.110 which killed 31 people. The cause was a faulty wing leading edge design. The DH.110 was grounded and strict safety procedures were subsequently enacted."
Maintenance error,"On 10 June 1990, the shift maintenance manager replaced the windscreen of British Airways Flight 5390 without reference to the maintenance documentation, which later caused the captain blown halfway out of the aircraft after the plane took off."
Weather,"Bad weather contiditon might cause plane crash. The category contains specific causes such as severe turbulence, windshear, and mountain wave."
Severe turbulence,"Powerful turbulence has, on occasion, resulted in damage to aircraft and injury to their occupants. About sixty people, two-thirds of them flight attendants, are injured by turbulence annually in the United States."
Windshear,"Wind shear refers to the variation of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15 m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22 m/s) for airliners at flight altitude."
Mountain wave,"Mountain Waves is defined as oscillations to the lee side (downwind) of high ground resulting from the disturbance in the horizontal air flow caused by the high ground."
Poor visibility,"On October 2016, two men died when their light aircraft crashed into Blackstairs mountain after entering an area of low visibility, an Air Accident Investigation Unit report has found."
Heavy rain,"Heavy rain can affect flight if the ambient air temperature at the altitude of the flight is at or below freezing. In that situation, rain which hits the aircraft may freeze upon contact, and can rapidly build up a dangerous accumulation of ice."
Severe winds,"On March 2016, a passenger jet circled a southern Russian airport in high winds and poor visibility, then crashed on a second landing attempt early Saturday, killing all 62 people aboard."
Icing,"In aviation, icing conditions are those atmospheric conditions that can lead to the formation of water ice on the surfaces of an aircraft, or within the engine as carburetor icing. Inlet icing is another engine-related danger, often occurring in jet aircraft."
Thunderstorms,"A thunderstorm brings together in one place just about every known weather hazard to aviation. Even a small thunderstorm would have the caloric equivalent of a Hiroshimatypeatomic weapon. It is the one weather event that should always be avoided."
Lightning strike,"It is estimated that on average, each airplane in the U.S. commercial fleet is struck lightly by lightning more than once each year. In fact, aircraft often trigger lightning when flying through a heavily charged region of a cloud."
Sabotage,"This category contains hijacking, shot down, and explosive device aboard."
Hijacking,"Aircraft hijacking is the unlawful seizure of an aircraft by an individual or a group. In most cases, the pilot is forced to fly according to the orders of the hijackers. Occasionally, however, the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves, such as the September 11 attacks."
Shot down,"On 17 July 2014, Flight MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was travelling over conflict-hit Ukraine on 17 July 2014 when it disappeared from radar. It is found out to be crashed after being hit by a Russian-made Buk missile over eastern Ukraine."
Explosive device aboard,"On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route, was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew, in what became known as the Lockerbie bombing."
Other,"Other causes for plane crashes, such as ATC error, ground crew error, and overloaded."
ATC error,"Mistakes made by air traffic controllers, whether miscommunication or overlooking essential data, could create dire airway situations.  And faulty air traffic control devices could mean the information relayed from the tower to the pilot is, simply, bad information."
Ground crew error,"The human errors that may be made by ground crews could ultimately may have an impact on the safety of a flight or on the performance of Air Crews and Aircraft Maintenance personnel."
Overloaded,"On January 8, 2003 , Air Midwest Flight 5481 crashed into a US Airways hangar and burst into flames 37 seconds after leaving the Airport. It was found out later that the plane was actually overloaded and out of balance due to the incorrect passenger weight estimates."
Improperly loaded cargo,"In April 2013, a cargo plane belonging to a U.S.-based company crashed shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on Monday, killing seven crew members. It was speculated that the cargo was improperly loaded or shifted during takeoff."
Bird strike,"Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engined ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in a number of fatal accidents."
Fuel contamination,"Contaminated fuel can cause significant damage to the aircraft and engine. Damage can range from fuel system corrosion, clogging of fuel filtration components, failure of aircraft fuel system instrumentation, and even stopping the fuel supply to the engines during flight."
Pilot incapacitation,"Pilot Incapacitation is the term used to describe the inability of a pilot, who is part of the operating crew, to carry out their normal duties because of the onset, during flight, of the effects of physiological factors."
Obstruction on runway,"The obstruction on the runaway might prevent the plane from landing, and therefore brings potential danger."
Midair collision caused by other plane,"Even it might be another plane’s fault, the midair collision could still kill all the people on both planes."
Fire or smoke in flight,"On 2 June 1983, Air Canada Flight 797 developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer skin and the inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 individuals who had yet to evacuate the aircraft."
