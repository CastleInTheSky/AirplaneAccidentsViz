# AirplaneAccidentsViz
Final project of CS171, Data Visualization 2016, Harvard

“Damn it, we are going to crash!” 
        
        - Airplane accidents visualization.


Group Name: Castle in the sky
Group Member: Bingfeng Xia, Xinyuan Wang, Rui Zhao, Xu Si


Brief introduction:
This website is to help people get a better idea of airplane accidents. We have unfolded and visualized the historical plane crash data in different ways in terms of region, time, causes, flight phase etc. We also present MH370 accidents in memory of the missing people. At last, we evaluated and compared different airlines to give reasonable suggestions.

Main visualization features:
* An animation of life lines demonstrating the age and expected lifespan of the passengers;
  - histograms showing the distribution of passengers’ age and potential lifespan;
  - three interactive filters showing information of passengers from different groups;
* A worldmap displaying airplane accidents region and time distribution;
  - using circles showing number of death per country per year;
  - using origin-destination line animation showing the airline route;
  - using tooltip shown accidents details per country or per route;
  - using timeline animation showing accidents in terms of year;
* A sunburst chart showing the cause hierarchy of plane accidents;
* A fisheye parallel coordinate graph presenting the distribution of plane accidents in each flying phase;
* A bar chart showing the total fatalities and accidients by month. 
  - brushing on timeline, a stackarea chart, to see changes
  - hovering over the bars to compare different months.
* An interative search box to compare safety ratings of added airlines;
  - zooming or clicking timelines can see accidents details;

A lot of work need to be done before this website can be published to public. However, we got "Best Project Award 2016 CS171". Woooooo!
